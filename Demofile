# This docker container serves as a base with a compiled version
# of Pixar USD toolchain. This is a separate container as the USD
# tools take several hours to build and are not updated very frequently.
# PLATTAR uses this base for other open source projects such as the
# xrutils toolchain.
# For more info on USD tools, visit https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD
