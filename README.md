_Python USD_ is a docker container that contains pre-built versions of [Pixar USD](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD) toolchain. Due to the amount of time it takes to build these tools, this container can serve as a useful base for other applications. Check out the Plattar [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/plattar/python-usd) repository for the latest pre-built images.
